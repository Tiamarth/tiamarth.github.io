            <p><i>I am Jonathan 'Tiamarth' McIntosh.</i> I'm a hobbyist and aspiring professional of many things, <i>primarily web design, creative writing, and video and audio production.</i> I've been dabbling in web design and audio and video production for several years, since around 2012, which is when my internet life more or less began. I've also been writing creatively as a hobby since I was in middle school, over a decade ago.</p>
            <p><i>In coding, I only write what's necessary</i> to get the product ready for market. I feel defeated if I have to use anything more than HTML and CSS in my web pages. <i>This website in particular sports a lean 140 lines of css, two images, and only three pages. There's no javascript, no flash, and no php.</i></p>
            <p><i>In my creative writing, I tend to balance descriptive narration with vague and subtle foreshadowing,</i> this paints a clear picture of the setting and pulls the reader into the world without overwhelming them with information. <i>I prefer writing stories which speculate about the nature of existence and the limits of reality, with worlds and plots that border on the stylistic and surreal.</i> Often the stories I write are more about a concept than about the characters themselves. You'll find my stories rarely close with a happy ending and usually contain 180&deg; plot twists.</p>
            <p><i>In my articles, I try to convey as much information as possible in as simple terms as possible.</i> One of my primary goals when writing tech articles is always for average users, particularly people who aren't necessarily skilled with technology, to be able to easily understand what I'm writing about. <i>Although, when I'm writing speculation and opinions about astronomy or science in general, I do like to use lofty and 'meta' phrasing.</i> You don't come here to learn how to code or learn scientific facts; you come here to learn how to optimize your web browser's settings or how to install software on Linux, or read ramblings about spirituality and the nature of human existence.</p>
            <p><i>My skills include css, html, php, and the ability to type at 120wpm. I used Linux as my daily system from 2014-2019</i> and have more than 2 decade's experience with various versions of Windows. I worked as a system administrator, tech support, web developer, and general design consultant for <a href='https://snippydoodles.com/'>Snippy Doodles</a> from 2012-2020. I was a system administrator for <a href='https://slimecraft.pt/'>Slimecraft</a> on and off for five years, from 2012-2017. <a href='https://tiamarth.github.io'>But that's not all I've done.</a></p>
